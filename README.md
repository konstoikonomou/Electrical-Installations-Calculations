# Electrical-Installations-Calculations

Files used for cooling load calculations of lighting and ventilation,
according to Energy Efficiency Ruling for buildings in Greece (K.En.A.K), 
as well as power calculations for installation components such as FCU/VRV
fans, circulators etc.

The calculations made using the scripts were then used in FineELEC software 
for a complete electrical installation.
